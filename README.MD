# My H61M-E22 Opencore Configuration

![Header](https://github.com/tetenc555/Opencore-H61ME22/blob/main/assets/header.png)

**This is my "gaming" desktop that i built from mainly e-waste! _Some parts i had to buy used tho~_**

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note im not an expert! This was built from scratch for my machine! I hope this works for other people, but the patches are made with this setup in mind!

> [!TIP]
> If your setup is close to mine and has just some different parts (mainly the processor/graphics card) you can probably tweak this repo a little bit to make it work!
